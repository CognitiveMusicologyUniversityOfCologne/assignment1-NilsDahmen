assignments to try out classroom

Dear all,  
this is a test assignment to try out GitHub classroom.  
  
For now, I want you to simply clone your assignment repository to your Jupyterlab folder with the following steps:
  
* sign into your jupyterhub account: https://jhmuwi.uni-koeln.de  
* open a new terminal window  
* clone into this repo, by copying the url at the top of your screen (git clone URL)
* configure your user data:
* git config user --local user.name "euer Name"
* git config user --local user.email "eure Mailadresse"
* please navigate to the folder in your jupyterlab sidebar
* create a new textfile
* write something nice in it
* save the file (file--> save)
* go back to the terminal window or launch a new one
* navigate to the folder of your cloned repo
  
* please use the triumvirate of git commands to submit your assignment:
* git add -A
* git commit -m "fancy commit message"
* git push
* you will have to enter your github credentials. 
  
You should be done! I set a deadline for some time next week. I would, however very much appreciate if you took a minute.  
We can discuss any issues that occured next week so I can sort out the workflow! :-)

Have a great evening!
Sebastian
